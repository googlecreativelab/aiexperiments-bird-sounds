## Bird Sounds
Thousands of bird sounds, visualized using machine learning.

## About

Bird sounds vary widely. This experiment uses machine learning to organize thousands of bird sounds. The computer wasn’t given tags or the birds’ names – only the audio. Using a technique called t-SNE, the computer created this map, where similar sounds are placed closer together.

## Front-end Installation

To build the client-side javascript, first install [node](https://nodejs.org) and [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/). Then you can install of the dependencies and build the files by typing the following in the terminal: 

```bash
npm install
webpack -p
```

## t-SNE

To generate a t-SNE with your own audio, check out [this repository](https://github.com/kylemcdonald/AudioNotebooks) from Kyle McDonald and the [Infinite Drum Machine](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/aiexperiments-drum-machine), which shares a lot of the same techniques.
